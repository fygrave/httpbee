agent should exhibit:

Autonomy
Cooperation
Learning

Autonomy - agent can function autonomously, without human guidance
Cooperation - iterract with other agents
Agent learning - improving agent performance over time


system where boundary between what agents do and what human do - is flexible

radical tailorability: do not make agent to try to figure out things, which
human can easily tell them

solves problems by retriving similar cases from database
selecting the best cases
adapting the cases
applying the solution
evaluating the solution

creating a new case:

retrive, teuse, revise, retain
